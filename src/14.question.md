# 🎅Santa Hides Behind Perf Review

> _[🎅Santa]_ Sadly, she's no longer a 10.
>
> _[🎩Bernard]_ Are we talking about the same thing??
>
> _[🎅Santa]_ Huh? Oh. Right, you were talking about the reindeer.
>
> _[🎩Bernard]_ Yeah, what were you talking about?
>
> _[🎅Santa]_ Nothing, nothing. So just tell them they'll get their raise when they can show some dedication to this business.
>
> _[🎩Bernard]_ The thing is they feel like they've more than accomplished that over the last 15 years since they last got a pay increase.
>
> _[🎅Santa]_ Tell them we'll review it during the next performance review.
>
> _[🎩Bernard, facepalming]_ And when is that?
>
> _[🎅Santa]_ When their performance improves! You think I just give raises to anyone who pulls a sleigh? This isn’t charity.

We need a type for a function that represents the performance review cycle. With this function in hand, perhaps 🎩Bernard will be able to convince 🎅Santa to take the reindeer's demands more seriously.
