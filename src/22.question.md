# A JSON Parsing Emergency

The elves need your help to build a type-safe JSON parser that can decode these critical messages from the sleigh! The parser should convert JSON strings into their equivalent TypeScript types, catching any errors as early as possible.

For example:

```typescript
type test = Parse<`{
  "altitude": 123,
  "warnings": [
    "low_fuel",\t\n
    "strong_winds",
  ],
}`>;
// Should become:
type test = {
  altitude: 123;
  warnings: ["low_fuel", "strong_winds"];
};
```

The parser MUST handle:

- Objects with string/number keys and any JSON value
- Arrays with mixed types
- Primitive values (strings, numbers, booleans, null)
- Nested objects and arrays
- Those dreaded trailing commas in objects and arrays
- Various amounts of whitespace and newlines

Break this challenge into smaller parts, parsing each part of the JSON structure one at a time and building up to the full parser.
