> _[💃Dancer]_ Look, ❤️Cupid. Here's the thing. We are close. We have 💋Crystal Right where we want her. We can use her to get what we want. And, after all, we'll be doing her a favor because she's also getting what she wants - to keep things about her and 🪩Jamie quiet.

> _[❤️Cupid]_ OUR TERMS BETTER BE BULLETPROOF BECAUSE THAT COOKIE-STEALING MANIAC IS GONNA FIND A WAY TO WEASLE OUT OF IT.
>
> _[💃Dancer]_ Yes. Absolutely. Let's make sure no term can conflict with any other. Think of it like designing a GraphQL Schema - no room for innovation.

The reindeer are almost ready to make their demands. Help the reindeer make terms for their demands in such a way that no term can be conflated with any other term.
