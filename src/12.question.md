# ðŸŽ©Bernard's Long List Of Names

> _[Things are staring to heat up in the North Pole. The reindeer have been blackmailing Mrs. Claus in order to get fair pay, threatening to expose her affair with ðŸª©Jamie Glitterglum.]_
>
> _[ðŸŽ…Santa]_ GET ME THOSE NAMES!!!!!!!!!!
>
> _[ðŸŽ©Bernard]_ I'm workin' on it, I'm workin' on it!
>
> _[ðŸŽ…Santa]_ TODAY! I NEED THEM TODAY!! ACTUALLY I NEED THEM LAST MONTH!!!
>
> _[ðŸŽ…Santa throws a giant box of delicate glass Christmas tree ornaments against the factory wall, sending shards of glass flying in every direction]_
>
> _[ðŸŽ©Bernard]_ Ah, there's the classic ðŸŽ…Santa we all know and love. Smashing priceless ornaments while screaming unintelligibly. Truly, the Christmas spirit personified.
>
> _[ðŸŽ…Santa]_ TODAY! I NEED THEM TODAY!! ACTUALLY I NEED THEM LAST MONTH!!!
>
> _[ðŸŽ©Bernard]_ You want every name? Fine. I'll even get you the ones with seven middle initials and the kids named after TikTok trends.

ðŸŽ©Bernard has a very long list of names from the Social Security Administration, but we need to format the data into objects so ðŸŽ…Santa can ingest it into his existing system.

Help ðŸŽ©Bernard before ðŸŽ…Santa continues his violent tirade. He's not about to spend a bunch of time looking at each child so instead he's just deciding whether a child is naughty or nice based on the number of characters in their name!

  <summary>A HUGE hint</summary>

Part of the fun/trick of this challenge is that you can't solve it normally by iterating because you'll get:

- `Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite.ts(2589)`
- `Type produces a tuple type that is too large to represent.ts(2799)`

For example, many people will probably first try:

```typescript
export type Solution<
  Row extends [string, string, string][],
  Accumulator extends { name: string; count: number }[] = [],
> =
  Row extends [[infer Name extends string, string, infer Count], ...infer Rest extends Row] ?
    Solution<
      Rest,
      [
        ...Accumulator,
        {
          name: Name;
          count: Count extends `${infer CountNum extends number}` ? CountNum : never;
        },
      ]
    >
  : Accumulator;
```

or the non tail-call recursive version:

```typescript
export type Solution<Row extends [string, string, string][]> =
  Row extends [[infer Name extends string, string, infer Count], ...infer Rest extends Row] ?
    [
      {
        name: Name;
        count: Count extends `${infer CountNum extends number}` ? CountNum : never;
      },
      ...Solution<Rest>,
    ]
  : [];
```

but that won't work at these scales. You need to find another way to iterate the array that doesn't involve recursion.
