# 🌟Vixen Confronts 🪩Jamie

> _[🪩Jamie]_ You're lying. You didn't see anything because nothing was happening. I haven't done anything wrong!
>
> _[🌟Vixen]_ I literally saw you and 💋Crystal with _my own two eyes_. Would you like me to describe the unicorn tattoo on your left cheek? Nice one, by the way.
>
> _[🪩Jamie, sweating]_ Damn it. You did see. What are you going to do?
>
> _[🌟Vixen]_ 🪩Jamie Glitterglum. It's not what _I am going to do to you_ but rather what \*you are going to do **for me\***.
>
> _[🪩Jamie]_ Huh?
>
> _[🌟Vixen]_ We've been arguing with Santa about our pay. You seem like someone uniquely positioned to help get him to change his mind.
>
> _[🪩Jamie]_ You absolute jerk! You're blackmailing me!
>
> _[🌟Vixen]_ Look, we all have our own goals. Get 💋Crystal to convince him to pay us what we're worth. We literally haven't had a pay raise since 2009. This shouldn't be so hard, but you know 🎅Santa. He could care less about the rest of us.
>
> _[🪩Jamie]_ Well how am I supposed to do that?
>
> _[🌟Vixen]_ There's an `npm` I've been working on, `santas-special-list`. Honestly it’s a mess of untyped spaghetti code and patched dependencies, so good luck with that. Let's start there. It needs types. I was supposed to do it, but I need some cover so I can discuss all this with the other reindeer. You make the types for me so I can slip away for a few hours. I'll find you tomorrow and let you know what you need to do next.
>
> _[🪩Jamie]_ I hate you. I have always hated you. Now I hate you more.
>
> _[🌟Vixen]_ After what you're about to do for me, I think we're going to be great friends. 🖤

🪩Jamie sure is in trouble. Help 🪩Jamie do 🌟Vixen's job by making types for the `santas-special-list` package. Things are really heating up in the North Pole!

What do you do, in TypeScript, if you have a situation where there's an `npm` you'd like to use but it doesn't have types? You need some way to declare types for that node module.
