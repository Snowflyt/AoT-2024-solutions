# Mind Control Is Surprisingly Effective

> _[ðŸŽ…Santa was the victim of a magical mind-control potion, prepared by his own Mrs. Claus: ðŸ’‹Crystal Claus. It's the next morning and ðŸŽ…Santa is just walking into the break room where all the reindeer were preparing for the day's chores.]_

> _[ðŸŽ…Santa]_ My dear _wonderful_ reindeer! How truly magnificent you all are! I don't do enough to show my appreciation for you!
>
> _[ðŸ”´Rudolph]_ Um. Are you feeling ok? Also, if the answer is "yes", you better not be about to give us $15 starbucks gift cards again as our "big bonus this season".
>
> _[ðŸŽ…Santa]_ ðŸ”´Rudolph, ðŸ”´Rudolph, sweet ðŸ”´Rudolph. I have had an awakening! It actually is $15 dollars! But it's a $15 dollar _per hour_ salary increase for _every reindeer_!!
>
> _[Silence. Utter silence in the room. The reindeer are in shock. Several long moments pass. The reindeer are expecting ðŸŽ…Santa to laugh in their faces and say it's all a joke...]_

> _[ðŸŽ…Santa]_ draw up some composable contracts! I'll sign them all today!

Think through the problem step by step, as if you were calling `h(g(f(a)))` in your own code. Start by individually typing all of the helper functions, then once you feel confident about those, work up from there. Don't forget about the `intrinsic` builtins!
