> _[🌟Vixen]_ Actually, funny you should raise that point because you pay us for a quality of work far below what we've just provided. You should be thrilled.

> _[🎅Santa]_ I don't want any more of that attitude from you, 🌟Vixen. I think you should think of the position that puts your colleagues in when you talk like that. Should I pay them less just so I can pay _you_ more? Huh?

> _[🌟Vixen]_ I'm getting tired of going around-and-around with you on this. Just tell us what you want.

> _[🎅Santa]_ Well for one thing, the route should be should be able to handle any arbitrary input! And while you’re at it, make the route solar-powered. The PR team says it’s time we went carbon neutral.
