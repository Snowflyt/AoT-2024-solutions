# 🎅Santa Refuses To Use Threads

> _[🎅Santa]_ How do you hoofed halfwits manage to screw up something a toddler with a crayon could figure out? I asked for the simplest thing I could imagine and you still couldn't do it! If you had two brain cells to rub together you'd understand that only numbers or strings are valid route identifiers!

> _[🌩️Donner]_ Please make a thead in this Slack channel, otherwise it gets too noisy and hard to follow. Also our Linear thing just made 3 tickets for each of your messages.

> _[🎅Santa]_ I am old school, I prefer IRC-style chatter. I do not value these "thread" things and find them difficult to use. I'll never do it, myself.

> _[🌟Vixen, in a thread]_ This isn’t 1997, Santa. Nobody cares about your IRC war stories. This is a company support channel with integrations designed to run the company better. How are you seriously against that??
>
> _[🎅Santa]_ I'm not against that, I'm just against using threads in chat apps.

Clearly we need to constrain our generic type a bit to only allow specific data types. 🎅Santa will probably also complain about that, but so it goes.

You might need to _"extend"_ the solution from Day 4.
